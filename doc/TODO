To Do

* Ability to delete products. Should check contracts and incidents and
  correct any inconsitancies
* Allow holidays to be cancelled after they've been approved, cancellations
  will need to be approved too probably?
* Mark previous holidays as 'spent' when holiday entitlement is changed
* Re-write the help
* Context 'actions' menus?
* Interface for editing incident product info questions
* Contact flags
* Internationalisation
* Interface for editing vendors
* Change maintenance table to use servicelevel field that stores tag instead of id
* Overhaul the email templates (emailtypes)
* Add tabbed incident_details popup window, with tabs relevant to SLA status
* Customer portal view of incidents, with ability to add/update incidents
* Monitor incidents by email, e.g. get an email when an incident is about to go out of SLA
* Update users status automatically based on data from the holiday calendar
  this would need to be a scheduled task that runs (at least) twice a day
* EMail admin contact for site with list of current contacts for contracts to ensure we have
  the correct contacts (could be a report, could by in the user portal)
* Ability to add more Roles
* Make all date and time formats consistantly use config files
