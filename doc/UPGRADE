Upgrading Support Incident Tracker
----------------------------------

To upgrade simply copy all the new files over the existing ones being
careful not to overwrite your config.inc.php or any custom themes you
might have.  Then run setup.php in your browser and follow the
instructions on-screen.

Further instructions and notes about specific upgrades follow:


Upgrading to 3.23
-----------------
As of v3.23 SiT! no longer require the php.ini setting register_globals
to be on.  Therefore we *strongly* recommend that you make sure your
php.ini has register_globals set OFF, this has been the default since
PHP 4.2.0 but since SiT! previously required it to be ON you should
check your php.ini.


Upgrading from 3.20 to 3.21
---------------------------
Email templates can now insert updates into the incident log that are
hidden from the customer view.
You should review your email templates and set the update visibility
of each.

The config variable attachment_path has been renamed to attachment_fspath
and a new variable attachment_webpath has been created for the web view
of the same path.
